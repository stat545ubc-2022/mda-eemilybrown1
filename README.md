This repository includes the code and outputs for the Mini-data analysis assignment in Stat545A at UBC.

There were two milestones for this assignment, which came along with a .Rmd file to edit and work within, which you can find within the respective Milestone folders. These files can be opened in R to run and edit the code. The results were also knitted into .md files which allow for easier viewing of the outputs.
